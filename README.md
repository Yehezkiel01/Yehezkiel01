### Welcome to my profile 👋

- 👨‍💻 I use my account mainly for school assignments and side projects.
- 🏘 I have contributed to few projects, some of which are public. You may find them pinned on my profile.
- 🔭 I’m working on two side projects, both of which are private, unfortunately. One is an ML-based project for a startup idea, whereas the other is an online learning web app for a private tutoring business.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN Stack through my web app project.
